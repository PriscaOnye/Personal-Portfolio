# Personal-Portfolio

My first Portfolio Webpage. 

I took the FreeCodeCamp Legacy Responsive Web Design Course and this is the 5th & last project to build and get a certificate.

It is also my very first portfolio Webpage, built with onky HTML and CSS. I am nearly done, 90% done.

Deployed on netlify, check it here.


I am done with the course and have set out to building other cool websites now, check my other projects in my Respository.
